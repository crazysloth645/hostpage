   <h3> Rationale:</h3>
<p>This was my introductory experience into understanding the behaviours of users through interviewing, observing and actually understanding their problems with the app GoodNotes. </p>

    <h3>Choice of Interface:</h3>
</div>
<div class="listObj">
	<div class="babyTitle">GoodNotes:</div> This is a note-taking application that a lot of students using IPads seem to like a lot. It digitally simulates taking notes in a physical notebook and allows students to organize their content in one place. Most often students use an Apple pencil as a stylus to use this application. Below is a rough sketch of what the GoodNotes interface looks like.</div>

  <div class="twoBlocksofText">
    <div class="doubleTextBox" id="dtb1">
<h4>Problems solved:</h4>
  <li>The inability to handwrite digital notes in an organized manner for academic purposes.  </li>
  <li>Physical notebooks take up too much space, can be a burden to carry around, are difficult to search through. </li>
  <li>Writing notes on Apple notes makes it difficult to organize and streams away from the folder structure of desktops that students are very used to. </li>
  <li>Searchability is low and time-consuming </li>
    </div>
    <div class="doubleTextBox" id="dtb2">
      <h4>Key components:
      </h4>
      <li>Page layout is reminiscent of a physical notebook with templates such as the yellow pages (pictured above)</li>
        <li>User can handwrite notes and search through them using the search button. Handwriting recognition on this app is pretty strong</li>
          <li>The interface lets the user rearrange content within a matter of very few clicks</li>
            <li>Files can be organized in a folder structure similar to that on a desktop</li>

  <h3>Key Observations</h3>
</div>
<div class="listObj">
A.	While reading, user scrolls down with finger of the same hand that they hold the pencil in. Doesn’t use their non-dominant hand.</div>
<div class="listObj">
B.	User flips over to landscape mode to write for longer period of time</div>
<div class="listObj">
C.	They load downloaded slides into the app and annotate it</div>
<div class="listObj">
D.	The iPad continues to remain on even when user is not actively using the app. Idle time causes battery wastage.
​</div>
<div class="listObj">
  E.	User scribbles extra notes in the margin and shifts content around pretty frequently using the lasso tool​

<h4>Quick Quentin:</h4>
  <li>Is a student who is overwhelmed by the number of tasks he has to complete and tries to find ways of optimizing his time whenever he can.  </li>
  <li>His problem is that he scribbles notes too quickly and so the searchability of his handwriting decreases. </li>
  <li>He also hates that he has to switch between his laptop and iPad because GoodNotes doesn’t have a convenient typing interface. </li>
  <li>My interviews have showed that a lot of users depend on GoodNotes for its quick note-taking ability. </li>
